## Introduction and purpose

Intermittent fasting is a process where one abstains from eating for certain time periods in hopes of improving heart health and hormone imbalances. This application was made for my cousin to help him better himself with trying this new intermittent fasting method. Since he carried his laptop to school all the time the platform of the application is **Desktop Java**, with embedded database systems the program works out-of-the-box on most systems.

## Capabilities

- **Initial setup**
  - Calculation of maintenance calories after input of data like age or weight
  - Choosing the fasting type (like 5-2, said to improve gut health or 16-8, which supposedly helps with fat reduction)
 
- **Home section**
  - Seeing the fasting hours as well as the time left in the fasting phase

- **Calendar section**
  - Seeing the days that have their data filled in
  - Modification of data at will via the interface (for weight and calorie tracking)

- **Exercise and meal sections**
  - Addition, removal or modification of different meals and exercises.
 
## Design phase

This is what the product was intended to look like as a rough draft.
